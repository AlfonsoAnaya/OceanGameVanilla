        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
            As climate change worsens not only will ocean levels rise, but the risk of destructive weather events, such
            as
            hurricanes, will increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this game, the goal is to prepare for an ever increasing ocean threat and prevent the destruction of
            the houses 🏠 in the map</p>
        <p>
            To protect your houses from the ocean you can build infrastructure to better withstand an "attack" from the
            ocean. If you have money in your account 🪙, you can click on any ground square to strengthen your
            infrastructure. It costs one coin 🪙 to make any one improvement:</p>
        <p class="center">beach 🏖️ → tree 🌳 → wall 🧱 → crane 🏗️</p>
        </p>
        Whenever a ground square gets attacked by an adjacent ocean square the ground infrastructure worsens.
        Importantly whenever a 🏖️ gets hit by the ocean that square turns into ocean 🌊. The downgrade in
        infrastructure follows the improvment sequence in reverse order:
        <p class="center">🧱 → 🌳 → 🏖️ → 🌊</p>
        <p>With the exception of the crane, which immediately turns into beach when attacked:</p>
        <p class="center">🏗️→ 🏖️</p>
        
        <p>
            🏖️ and 🏗️ squares have special properties.</p>
            <p>For every two 🏖️ you get one coin at the beginning of the season,
            but be careful! Beaches can easily turn into ocean!</p>
            <p>If you want to reclaim terrain from the sea you can construct a crane in a square adjacent to
            the ocean. At the begginning of each season there is a 33% chance that a ocean square adjacent to a
            crane is turned into a beach. But be careful! Each crane is costly to construct and a single ocean attack
            turnst it into a 🏖️.
