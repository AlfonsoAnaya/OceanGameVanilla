        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
            As climate change worsens not only will ocean levels rise, but the risk of destructive weather events, such
            as
            hurricanes, will increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this game, the goal is to prepare for an ever increasing ocean threat and prevent the destruction of
            the houses 🏠 in the map. You win by reaching the year 2100 with both houses intact.</p>
        <h3>1</h3>
        <p>
            To protect your houses from the ocean you can build infrastructure to better withstand an "attack" from the
            ocean. If you have money in your account 🪙, you can <strong>click</strong> on any ground square to strengthen your
            infrastructure. It costs one coin 🪙 to make any one improvement:
        </p>
        <p class="center">
            beach 🏖️ → tree 🌳 → wall 🧱 → crane 🏗️
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a ground square gets attacked by an adjacent ocean square the ground infrastructure worsens.
            Importantly whenever a 🏖️ gets hit by the ocean that square turns into ocean 🌊. The downgrade in
            infrastructure follows the improvment sequence in reverse order:
        </p>
        <p class="center">
            🧱 → 🌳 → 🏖️ → 🌊
        </p>
        <p>With the exception of the crane, which immediately turns into beach when attacked:</p>
        <p class="center">
            🏗️→ 🏖️
        </p>
        <h3>2</h3>
        <p>
            🏖️ and 🏗️ squares have special properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            For every two 🏖️ you get one coin at the beginning of the season,
            but be careful! Beaches can easily turn into ocean!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to reclaim terrain from the sea you can construct a crane in a square adjacent to
            the ocean. At the begginning of each season there is a 33% chance that a ocean square adjacent to a
            crane is turned into a beach. But be careful! Each crane is costly to construct and a single ocean attack
            turnst it into a 🏖️.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a 🏗️ is no longer useful because all adjacent squares are solid ground, you can sell it for one coin by 
            <strong>right-clicking</strong> on it.
        </p>
        <h3>3</h3>
        <p>
            Every season, the ocean will attack the coast. You can trigger a new season by clicking the button
            <strong>New Season</strong>
            An ocean square can attack any adjacent coast square.
            But the strength of the attack changes from year to year.
            Also, there are normal years and hurricane years.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a normal year, there are from 0 (if you're lucky) to 6 random ocean squares that will attack the coast. 
            It is possible for the same coast square to be attacked by the ocean on multiple directions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a hurricane year all ocean squares adjacent to the land will attack the land. Each decade the probability
            that a year is a hurricane year increases. In the 2020s the probability is 14%. By the 2090s the probability
            is 19%.
